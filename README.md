# 360mash
A simple desktop tool to post-process and render 2D and 360 video.

360mash is an open source project to develop a free, cross-platform, lightweight tool for clipping, reframming and anonymising 2D, 180 and 360 videos and exporting the resulting video as fast as possible. The tool is primarily aimed at researchers using qualitative video-based methods, but can be used by anyone working with video.

## Building from source

It's important to clone all submodules when cloning. This can be done with for example:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Big-Video/360mash.git
```
